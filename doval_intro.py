<h4>Pitching Performance Summary</h4>
<p>This dashboard presents a clean, data-driven breakdown of Camilo Doval’s performance across five seasons (2020–2025). It highlights year-over-year trends in key metrics to help identify his strengths, evolution, and areas of consistency.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Velocity & Spin Rate:</b> Tracks average pitch speed and spin rate by year. These indicators reflect Doval’s raw arm talent and pitch movement. His velocity peaked in 2023, while spin rate rebounded to elite levels in 2025.</li>

  <li><b>Pitch Usage Breakdown:</b> Visualizes the percentage of each pitch type thrown per season. Notably, Doval’s slider became his dominant weapon (58.1% in 2025), while the sinker was phased out—suggesting strategic refinement and role clarity.</li>

  <li><b>Release Extension:</b> Measures how far off the mound he releases the ball. Doval consistently averaged 6.3–6.6 feet, which helps reduce hitter reaction time and maintain deception. A dip in 2024 was followed by a full rebound in 2025.</li>

  <li><b>Whiff Rate:</b> Calculates swing-and-miss efficiency across all pitches. Doval’s whiff rate remained elite (0.928–0.978), confirming his ability to miss bats—even during velocity dips.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each metric is designed to support scouting evaluations, pitch design decisions, and long-term player development strategy.</p>
