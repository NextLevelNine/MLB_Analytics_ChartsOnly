<h4>What the Dashboard Displays</h4>
<ol>
  <li><b>Velocity & Spin Rate</b><br>
  <b>What it shows:</b> Yearly averages for pitch velocity and spin rate.<br>
  <b>Why it matters:</b> Reflects Doval’s raw arm strength and ability to generate movement. His velocity peaked in 2023 (95.26 mph), and spin rate rebounded to elite levels in 2025 (2555.13 rpm), suggesting sustained pitch effectiveness.</li>

  <li><b>Pitch Usage Breakdown</b><br>
  <b>What it shows:</b> Percentage of each pitch type thrown annually.<br>
  <b>Why it matters:</b> Reveals strategic evolution. Doval increased his slider usage dramatically (58.1% in 2025) while phasing out the sinker—indicating adjustments in pitch sequencing and role clarity.</li>

  <li><b>Release Extension</b><br>
  <b>What it shows:</b> How far off the mound the ball is released.<br>
  <b>Why it matters:</b> Impacts perceived velocity and deception. Doval averaged 6.3–6.6 feet, with a slight dip in 2024 and recovery in 2025—highlighting mechanical stability and durability.</li>

  <li><b>Whiff Rate</b><br>
  <b>What it shows:</b> Swing-and-miss rate across all pitches.<br>
  <b>Why it matters:</b> A direct measure of dominance. Doval posted elite whiff rates (0.928–0.978) across all seasons, maintaining effectiveness even when velocity slightly dipped.</li>
